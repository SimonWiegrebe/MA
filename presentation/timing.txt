ito motiv, s.u.d. has become a valuable data source to both commercial enterprises and behavioral researchers
latter ones mostly uses this data to study human behavior through smartphone usage
yet they mostly focus on the association between observed smartphone usage patterns and self-declared
personality traits (e.g., through a Big 5 questionnaire)
in this work, on the other hand, I chose a data-centric approach where I seek to model behavioral sequences
by predicting actually observed behavior

the idea of this research is to use sud collected as part of a PhoneStudy project and exploit its natural
sequential order: i.e., app sessions
...
this way, we can model behavioral sequences by means of next-event prediction, that is, by predicting the
next app a user is going to use
and we can then compare our predictions with actually observed ground truth data

how could e generate thus predictions? well, we have a large number ...

the data was collecteed in the course of a mobile sensing research project
it comprises 310 participants (users) and approximately a 3-month study period
for each user, we have the exact opening date and time of each app
and we assign to each app a unique numeric app ID and to each session a unique numeric session ID
so here we see that the first two sessions of the first user were ON-OFF session,
just like the last session of the last user
