# Outline

# Introduction

# Theoretical Framework

- early works (big 5)
- uncouple from psych context: app2vec
  - app analogies not very intuitive (example)
  - how to evaluate performance?
- uncouple from psych context, focus exclusively on sequential nature of data
  - time-ordered sequences, imposing session structure
  - similarity to data from movie ratings, e-commerce sessions, social networking sites:
    - several users
    - 1+ sessions per user
    - 1+ events per session
  - use RS models
    - target variable follows a multinomial distribution with a large number of distinct outcomes
    - task is to create a recommendation list
- intrinsic similarity to language data
- session-based and session-aware RS  

# Data

- description (+ table)
- representation  and preprocessing: app-level 
- representation  and preprocessing: sequence-level
- representation  and preprocessing: app-to-text conversion

# Methodology

- modeling
  - session-based baseline models
  - session-based neural models
  - session-aware neural models
  - extensions
- evaluation
  - train-validation-test split
  - evaluation protocol
  - evaluation metrics
  - tuning

# Results

- app-level
  - overall performance   
  - minimum sequence length
  - position in test sequence
  - removing on and off
  - category-level prediction
  - embedding analysis
- sequence-level
  - overall performance
  - removing on and off 
  - position in test sequence



- sequence-level
